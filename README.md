## Introductions

This project is designed for the large number of systems that do not have the Compass app pre-installed. Google Play is flooded with a large number of complex functional Compass apps, and they often contain advertisements. Many users put up with these apps just for such a simple feature, so I wrote this little gadget that you just open and use, hoping it will help you.

## Features

* Simple interface and straightforward functions
* Compact size, with an installer size of no more than 37kb
* High compatibility, from Android 4.4 to the latest versions

## Acknowledgements
